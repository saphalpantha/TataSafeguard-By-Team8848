## Project Title -
 - TataSafeguard: A Comprehensive Analysis of Wiring Malfunctions, Structural Damage and Recommendations for Aircraft & Automobiles

## Problem Statement -
-Aircraft and Automobiles maintenance ensures safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance. Assessing and repairing damage and faulty wiring are essential for safety.

-Structural damage and faulty wiring can lead to catastrophic failures, in-flight emergencies, or fires, endangering passengers and crew.

-Regular inspections and timely repairs are crucial to prevent accidents and maintain public confidence in aviation and automobiles industry.

-Market size and growth potential: The aviation maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) market is projected to reach $92.4 billion by 2026, while the automotive repair market is estimated at over $750 billion
